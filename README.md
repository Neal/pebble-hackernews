It uses [Hacker News API](http://hndroidapi.appspot.com/) to get the stories and [Clipped API](http://clipped.me/api.html) to summarize them.

Long click select in the story list view refreshes the list (until i figure out a better way to use it).

### Known Issues

* Loading stories fail sometimes (API limitation).
* Can not summarize some stories (API limitation).

### Future Plans

* A comments view.
* A settings view to change font size.
* Being able to upvote stories and comments.
* Add Pocket support.


Contributions are much welcome!
